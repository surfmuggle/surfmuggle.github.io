Possible feature request for vscode

### Provide ability to ignore empty lines in diff editor (feature request)

Similar to #198381 it would be great to have a setting to ignore empty lines 

**New Feature**

 * In settings it's possible to set "diffEditor.ignoreEmptyLine": true

**Current status**

 * to my knowledge there's no option to ignore empty lines in the diffEditor,

**Sample**
