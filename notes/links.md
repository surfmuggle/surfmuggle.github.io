## Speech to Text

### Speech to text with Lamafile
The [llamafile release 0.8.13](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/releases/tag/0.8.13) 

> introduces whisperfile which is a single-file implementation of OpenAI's Whisper model. It lets you transcribe speech
 to text and even translate it too. Our implementation is based off Georgi Gerganov's [whisper.cpp](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) project.

**llamafile** is a "_web GUI chatbot, a turnkey OpenAI API compatible server, and a [shell-scriptable](https://justine.lol/oneliners/) CLI interface_". 

### Deep Speech
[Mozilla DeepSpeech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) is 
> an open source embedded (offline, on-device) speech-to-text engine which can run in real time on devices ranging from a Raspberry Pi 4 to high power GPU servers.

[It seems it was discontinued in december 2021](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech/issues/3693)
