## Extract from [RR619 Evaluating the protection afforded by surgical masks against influenza bioaerosols (2008)][1] 

From  the  results  of  this  study,  it  can  be  concluded  that  surgical masks  will  mitigate  a  mean  reduction  factor  of  around  2  against  a  simulated  sneeze  of  inert airborne particles ...

In principle,  surgical  masks  that  are  worn  correctly  should  provide  adequate  protection  against large  droplets,  splashes  and  contact  transmission.  They  may  also  reduce  to  some  degree  any residual  aerosol  risk,  although  this  level  of  protection  might  not  sufficiently  reduce  the likelihood  of  transmission  via  this  route.  Consequently  they  should  not  be  used  in  situations where close exposure to infectious aerosols is likely.

The CDC recommends that healthcare settings provide influenza patients with facemasks as a means of reducingtransmission to staff and other patients, and a recent report suggested that surgical masks can capture influenza virus inlarge droplet spray. However, there is minimal data on influenza virus aerosol shedding, the infectiousness of exhaledaerosols, and none on the impact of facemasks on viral aerosol shedding from patients with seasonal influenza.  Wecollected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions (‘‘coarse’’.5mm,‘‘fine’’#5mm) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitativeRT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable viru

 * [Dr Julian Tang][ajt] works on the use of 3D printed polyvinyl acetate strips in surgical masks to trap exhaled pathogens – including respiratory viruses. Currently, these masks are being developed for use in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in suspected COVID-19 patients before and as their symptoms develop ([source][ajt]).
