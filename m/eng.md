Excellent question — capitalization (using **uppercase** instead of **lowercase**) in English follows a number of clear grammatical and stylistic rules. Here’s a full overview 👇

---

## 🅰️ **When to Use Uppercase (Capital) Letters**

### 1. **At the beginning of a sentence**

* Always capitalize the **first letter** of the first word in a sentence.

  > ✅ *The cat is sleeping.*
  > ❌ *the cat is sleeping.*

---

### 2. **The pronoun “I”**

* Always capitalize the word **I**, even in the middle of a sentence.

  > ✅ *My brother and I went to the park.*
  > ❌ *My brother and i went to the park.*

---

### 3. **Proper nouns**

Capitalize **specific names** of people, places, things, or organizations.

| Category                                | Examples                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **People’s names**                      | *Alice, Dr. Smith, William Shakespeare*             |
| **Geographical names**                  | *London, the Pacific Ocean, Mount Everest*          |
| **Institutions / companies**            | *Harvard University, Microsoft, the United Nations* |
| **Brands**                              | *Coca-Cola, Nike, Apple*                            |
| **Days, months, holidays**              | *Monday, October, Christmas*                        |
| **Languages, nationalities, religions** | *English, French, Buddhism, Christianity*           |

> ✅ *I visited New York City in June.*
> ❌ *I visited new york city in june.*

### 4. **Titles**

Capitalize **titles of books, films, works of art, or documents**, following style guides (e.g., title case):

> *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone*
> *The Great Gatsby*
> *Declaration of Independence*

Also, capitalize **titles before a person’s name**:

> ✅ *President Lincoln*, *Doctor Jones*, *Professor Smith*
> But not when the title follows the name:
> ✅ *Abraham Lincoln was the president.*

---

### 5. **The first word in a quote (if it’s a full sentence)**

> ✅ She said, “**We need to leave now.**”
> ✅ He asked, “**Are you ready?**”
> ❌ She said, “**we need to leave now.**”

---

### 6. **Acronyms and initialisms**

All letters are capitalized.

> *NASA, FBI, USA, BBC*

---

### 7. **The first word of each line in poetry (optional)**

This is a stylistic convention.

> *Roses are red,
> Violets are blue…*

## 🔡 **When to Use Lowercase**

Everything else stays **lowercase**, including:

* Common nouns: *dog, city, mountain, teacher*
* Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions in running text: *a, the, and, of, in*
* Adjectives not part of a proper name: *french fries* (not *French fries* unless referring to nationality)
