### List of facilities
 - **Wales**:
    - [Comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuZ3nqzC6a0) Electric Mountain in Wales has been running since 1984. 
      It can contribute a maximum power of 1.73GW to the UK grid and has a storage capacity of around 9.1 GWh. 
      It pumps the water up to the top at night when electricity is cheap and let's it run back down during the day in high demand. 
      From memory they can turn around from pumping up to generating in just 20 seconds. They make the most money by being able to 
      respond quickly to dynamic load changes during this phase of operation. It was really worth a visit to see the giant pumps inside the mountain.
 - **Slovakia**:
   - Comment: largest pumped hydro plant Čierny Váh has 7 turbines with collective power of 735MW (6 Francis @ 122MW and 1 Kaplan @ 0,7MW) and head of about 400m.
About 83% of our power is produced in 2 nuclear power plants and 11% in hydro plants.
Only 5% of electricity in Slovakia comes from fossil fuels.
