# Influenca - benefit of a shot 
Based on Influenca reports from the german RKI [2015 page 80](https://influenza.rki.de/Saisonberichte/2015.pdf) or [2018 page 105](https://influenza.rki.de/Saisonberichte/2018.pdf) 
i want to understand how many persons must get a shot  (Number Meeded to Treat (NNT)) to prevent 1 influenca case. I assume that one case means a positive PCR Test for influence + symptoms.

 - But a confidence interval that ranges from below 0 to above 0 means that some patients have no benefit but a disadvantage from taking the drug. 

## Relative Risk Redution with absolute numbers

Provide in a table two samples A and B . Sample A show how a high RRR could be a low ARR and also sample B what RRR a high ARR has

This updated table includes absolute numbers of people in each group (control and treatment) to illustrate how the Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) and Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) are calculated. The table also breaks down outcomes (ill and healthy) for each sample, where \(n = o + no\) (i.e., total number of patients = number of patients with the outcome + number of patients without the outcome).

| **Sample**           | **Group**      | **Total (n)** | **Outcome (o)** | **No Outcome (no)** | **Event Rate (CER/EER)** | **Relative Risk (RR)** | **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)** | **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **A (High RRR, Low ARR)** | Control (no treatment) | 1000         | 50              | 950                 | \( \frac{50}{1000} = 0.05 \)    |                        |                                   |                                   |
|                      | Treatment      | 1000         | 10              | 990                 | \( \frac{10}{1000} = 0.01 \)    | \(\frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.20\) | \(1 - 0.20 = 0.80\) (80%)         | \(0.05 - 0.01 = 0.04\) (4%)       |
| **B (High ARR, Lower RRR)** | Control (no treatment) | 1000         | 500             | 500                 | \( \frac{500}{1000} = 0.50 \)   |                        |                                   |                                   |
|                      | Treatment      | 1000         | 300             | 700                 | \( \frac{300}{1000} = 0.30 \)   | \(\frac{0.30}{0.50} = 0.60\) | \(1 - 0.60 = 0.40\) (40%)         | \(0.50 - 0.30 = 0.20\) (20%)      |

### **Explanation**:

1. **Sample A (High RRR, Low ARR)**:
   - **Control group**: Out of 1000 people, 50 experience the outcome (illness), and 950 do not.
   - **Treatment group**: Out of 1000 people, only 10 experience the outcome, while 990 do not.
   - The **Control Event Rate (CER)** is 5%, and the **Treatment Event Rate (EER)** is 1%.
   - **RRR** is high (80%), but the **ARR** is low (4%), because the event rate in the control group is already low.

2. **Sample B (High ARR, Lower RRR)**:
   - **Control group**: Out of 1000 people, 500 experience the outcome, and 500 do not.
   - **Treatment group**: Out of 1000 people, 300 experience the outcome, and 700 do not.
   - The **Control Event Rate (CER)** is 50%, and the **Treatment Event Rate (EER)** is 30%.
   - **RRR** is lower (40%), but the **ARR** is high (20%) because the baseline risk in the control group is high, so a larger absolute number of people benefit from the treatment.

### Summary:
- **Sample A** demonstrates that even with a high RRR (80%), the actual benefit (ARR) is small because few people in the control group experienced the outcome.
- **Sample B** shows that a moderate RRR (40%) can still result in a high ARR (20%) when more people in the control group experience the outcome.

This table gives a clear view of how absolute numbers of patients impact these statistical measures.

## Absolute Risk Reduction

Yes, **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)** can be used to calculate the **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**, but you need the **Control Event Rate (CER)** to do so.

### Here's how it works:

- **Relative Risk (RR)** is the ratio of the event rate in the treatment group (EER) to the event rate in the control group (CER):
  \[
  RR = \frac{EER}{CER}
  \]
  
- **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)** is the proportional reduction in risk between the control group and the treatment group:
  \[
  RRR = 1 - RR = 1 - \frac{EER}{CER}
  \]

### To calculate **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** from **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)**, you also need to know the Control Event Rate (CER):

\[
ARR = CER \times RRR
\]

### Example:

Let’s say you know the following:
- **Control Event Rate (CER)** = 0.30 (30% of patients in the control group experience the outcome)
- **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)** = 0.33 (33% reduction in risk due to treatment)

You can calculate **ARR** as:

\[
ARR = 0.30 \times 0.33 = 0.099
\]

So the **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** is **0.099**, or **9.9%**.

### Key Relationship:

- **RRR** tells you how much the risk is reduced relative to the control group's risk, but it doesn't take into account the baseline risk (CER).
- **ARR** gives you a more direct sense of the **actual number of events prevented**, which is usually more useful for clinical decisions.

### Conclusion:
Yes, you can calculate **ARR** using **RRR** as long as you know the **CER**. This is useful because **ARR** is a more concrete measure of how effective a treatment is in absolute terms, while **RRR** only shows the proportionate reduction.

## Compare high and low ARR

Here is a table that illustrates how a high **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)** can result in a low **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** (Sample A), and how a high **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** can correspond to a lower **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)** (Sample B):

| **Sample** | **Control Event Rate (CER)** | **Treatment Event Rate (EER)** | **Relative Risk (RR)** | **Relative Risk Reduction (RRR)** | **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** |
|------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **A (High RRR, Low ARR)** | 0.05 (5%)                        | 0.01 (1%)                       | \(\frac{0.01}{0.05} = 0.20\)       | \(1 - 0.20 = 0.80\) (80%)         | \(0.05 - 0.01 = 0.04\) (4%)       |
| **B (High ARR, Lower RRR)** | 0.50 (50%)                       | 0.30 (30%)                      | \(\frac{0.30}{0.50} = 0.60\)       | \(1 - 0.60 = 0.40\) (40%)         | \(0.50 - 0.30 = 0.20\) (20%)      |

### **Explanation**:

1. **Sample A (High RRR, Low ARR)**:
   - **Control Event Rate (CER)**: 5%
   - **Treatment Event Rate (EER)**: 1%
   - **RRR** is 80%: This means the treatment reduces the relative risk of the outcome by 80%, which sounds impressive. 
   - However, the **ARR** is only 4% because the baseline risk (CER) is very low, so the actual reduction in absolute terms is small despite the high relative reduction.

2. **Sample B (High ARR, Lower RRR)**:
   - **Control Event Rate (CER)**: 50%
   - **Treatment Event Rate (EER)**: 30%
   - **RRR** is 40%, meaning the relative reduction is smaller than in Sample A.
   - However, the **ARR** is much higher at 20%, because the baseline risk (CER) is higher, making the absolute reduction in risk more significant.

### Conclusion:
- **High RRR with low ARR** occurs when the baseline risk (CER) is very low, so even a big percentage reduction results in a small absolute difference.
- **High ARR with lower RRR** happens when the baseline risk (CER) is high, so even a smaller percentage reduction translates to a large absolute effect.

This shows how both **RRR** and **ARR** can give different perspectives on the effectiveness of a treatment.

## Number Needed to Treat (NNT)

Ah, you're referring to the **Number Needed to Treat (NNT)**, which is a measure used in healthcare to indicate how many patients need to receive a treatment (intervention) to prevent one additional negative outcome (such as an illness, death, etc.).

### **How NNT is Calculated:**

The NNT is calculated as the inverse of the **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)** between two groups—one receiving the intervention (treatment) and the other receiving a control (placebo or standard care). Here's the formula:

\[
NNT = \frac{1}{ARR}
\]

Where:
- **ARR (Absolute Risk Reduction)** is the difference in event rates (or risk) between the control group and the treatment group.
  
### **Steps to Calculate NNT:**

1. **Calculate Event Rate in the Control Group (CER):** 
   \[
   CER = \frac{\text{Number of events in control group}}{\text{Total in control group}}
   \]
   This is the proportion of patients in the control group who experienced the outcome (e.g., illness).

2. **Calculate Event Rate in the Treatment Group (EER):**
   \[
   EER = \frac{\text{Number of events in treatment group}}{\text{Total in treatment group}}
   \]
   This is the proportion of patients in the treatment group who experienced the outcome.

3. **Calculate ARR (Absolute Risk Reduction):**
   \[
   ARR = CER - EER
   \]
   This is the difference between the event rates in the two groups.

4. **Calculate NNT:**
   \[
   NNT = \frac{1}{ARR}
   \]
   This tells you how many people need to be treated to prevent one additional outcome.

### **Can NNT be Calculated from a 95% Confidence Interval?**

Yes, you can **estimate the NNT** from a 95% confidence interval (CI) around the **Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)**. This gives an idea of the **range of possible NNT values** based on the confidence interval. Here's how:

1. **Confidence Interval for ARR**: If you have a 95% confidence interval for the ARR, it will look something like this:
   \[
   \text{CI for ARR} = [\text{lower bound}, \text{upper bound}]
   \]

2. **Convert the Confidence Interval for ARR to NNT**:
   \[
   NNT_{\text{lower}} = \frac{1}{\text{upper bound of ARR}}
   \]
   \[
   NNT_{\text{upper}} = \frac{1}{\text{lower bound of ARR}}
   \]

   By using the confidence interval limits of the ARR, you can calculate the lower and upper bounds for the NNT. This gives you a **range of NNT values** based on the 95% confidence interval.

---

### **Interpreting the NNT and Confidence Interval**

- If the confidence interval for ARR crosses zero (e.g., it goes from negative to positive), it means there is uncertainty about whether the treatment is actually beneficial or harmful. This might result in a confidence interval for NNT that includes both very large positive values and negative values (which isn't meaningful, but indicates lack of certainty).
  
- A **narrow confidence interval** around the NNT suggests that the treatment effect is more certain. A **wide interval** suggests more variability and uncertainty in the treatment’s effectiveness.

---

### **Example Calculation:**

Suppose you have:
- Event rate in control group (CER) = 0.30 (30%)
- Event rate in treatment group (EER) = 0.20 (20%)

**Step 1:** Calculate ARR:
\[
ARR = 0.30 - 0.20 = 0.10 (10\%)
\]

**Step 2:** Calculate NNT:
\[
NNT = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10
\]
This means 10 patients need to be treated to prevent one additional illness.

If you have a 95% confidence interval for ARR, say [0.05, 0.15], you can calculate the confidence interval for NNT:
- \(\frac{1}{0.15} = 6.67\)
- \(\frac{1}{0.05} = 20\)

So, the 95% confidence interval for NNT would be from **6.67 to 20**, meaning that between 7 and 20 people need to be treated to prevent one additional outcome, based on the variability in the data.
