# Basics about greenhous gases

Gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range is called a greenhouse gas (GHG)<sup>[1](#GHG)</sup>.
Common. An atmosphere that contains GHG reduces radiative heat loss[8]
Primary GHG are water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone (O3).<sup>[1](#GHG)</sup>
The affect of GHG <sup>[2](#GHEF)</sup> is critical for life on earth; without it the average surface  temperature of earth would be about −18 °C (0 °F),[2] rather than the present average of 15 °C <sup>[1](#GHG)</sup>
